## Submission Instructions

### Overview
When it comes to elementary school, reading is a large part of the curriculum.  With my own children, I have found that making reading part of our day has helped with comprehension.  I would love to say that this was an easy addition to our day, but reading time can easily be pushed aside for tasks that seem more important such as accompanying me to the grocery store, cleaning a bedroom, or even rushing through bedtime.  Building this habit is just as much my job as theirs.  

The purpose of this website is to create a record of reading that can be used within the family or shared with teachers.  While a book API could easily be imported, at this stage I want as few distractions for my kids as possible.  Book information is collected from user input.  Reading information is collected via background date and timer collections.  The information is then displayed in tables and a calendar.  The reason a variety of data is being collected is to meet the various reading requirements of any teacher in any school year.  In kindergarten, book titles were requested, in second grade times and page numbers were requested.  This will collect both and be able to share data with a teacher.  

### Features
_User Login_ 
As a user, I want to be able to track my own books, reading time, and reading habits.  

_User Registartion_  
As a user, I want to be able to create an account for my child using my email.  
I want to create a unique username and password for each child.  

_User Dashboard_ :
As a user, I want to easily begin reading without having to push too many button.
As a user, I want to be asked what I am reading and have a chance to select from my currently reading list or add a new book.
As a user, I want to be able to enter the page number from which I’m starting at.  
As a user, when I select start reading, I want to return to the dashboard so that I have easy access to the “Finished Reading” button.  
As a user, when I select START I want to start a timer to track my reading.  

_Reading timer_  
As a user, I would like a timer to start running when I hit the START READING button and stop when I select the FINISHED READING button.
I want this timer’s total to be uploaded to both the reading table and the calendar

_Sharing my data_ 
As a user, I would like to send a copy of the tables to my parent so they can forward them to my teacher.  (This is roundabout, but this is designed for minors and I don’t want to have too many safety/privacy issues right now)

_Algorithms_ 
Update the reading tables when all the pages are read
Update tables with reading times, totalling with each session

_Tables_ 
As a user, I would like to have a table built to manage my books.  
One table for books I am CURRENTLY reading.  The titles in this table will be used to fill a dropdown menu when starting a reading session.
One table for COMPLETED reading.  

_Calendar_
As a user, I want to have a calendar representation of the days I have read.  
I want the calendar to change colors on days I read.  ***
I want the title of the book to appear on days I’ve completed the book  ***

_Nav Bar_
As a user (or parent of a user) I want to have an easy way to see my tables and calendar, add  book without hitting the timer, and share.

### Technologies

I plan to build this using ASP.NET, C#, and bootstrap.
I want to incorporate user accounts and authorization
I want to utilize timestamps, timers
I want to use a navigation bar

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to review all technologies above
The Relationships between my tables
I will need to learn how to keep it simple, streamline, and remember the minimum standards (I get very lost in details)
