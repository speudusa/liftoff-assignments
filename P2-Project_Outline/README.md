## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As a parent of 2 elementary schoolers, tracking our reading time is a big deal in the early grades.  Many times a worksheet is sent home to be filled out and returned the following Monday.  Once those workseets are turned in, I never see them again.  This prevents me from remembering what we read, or even allowing me to see what my oldest (and very independent reader) enjoys because she writes it down over and over.  The purpose of this app is to track the books into tables that can easily be emailed to teachers and easily referenced by me to track our reading levels, speed, and even favorites.  

### Features
_User Login_ As a user, I want to be able to track my own books.  

_User Dashboard_ As a user, I want a page where I can easily see the books I've read (title, author, pages) and the books I am currently reading (same as read).  I also want to keep track of my reading average.  (As I develop this more, I would like to have an early reader option, where I could track level of reading independence progress).  On the dashboard I would like to be able to start my reading session.

_Reading timer_  As a user, I would like a timer to start my reading session that would collect page numbers and book information, and a textbox for notes.  

_Sharing my data_ As a user, I would like to send a copy of the tables (reading and read) to my teacher at the end of the week so they could see my progress.

_Algorithms_  I would like to track the percentage of pages read not only to track progress, but also as a point of moving a book from the reading table to the read table.  I would like to track average reading times and average reading speed overall.  (Again, with more development, perhaps these averages per each book)

### Technologies
C#
ASP.NET
Bootstrap/CSS/HTML
Authorization/Authentication (Ch 21)
Look into a timer function/feature
Time management (pomodoro timers, assessing urgency for tasks, and making the most of my time)


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to review all technologies above
I will need to learn how to keep it simple, streamline, and remember the minimum standards (I get very lost in details)
